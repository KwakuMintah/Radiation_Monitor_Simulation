# Radiation_Monitor_Simulation

Our third year group project is to create a way to safely simulate a training environment of using a radiation detection monitor without radioactive sources. To achieve the goal of creating a working prototype, we will support our decisions with computational simulations. These simulations will be exploring aspects such as functional range and angle of components, shielding effects of various mediums,and true randomness of decay. The work behind this simulation is found on this Repository.
